# secd

A silly implementation of the
[SECD machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECD_machine), adapted from
_The Architecture of Symbolic Computers_.

**The good news:** This was fun and educational. I plan to compile a toy
  language into SECD instructions.

**The bad news:** It's about 400x slower than Clojure. Oops.
